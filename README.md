CS 1372: Program Design for Engineers Assignments

## Description
This repository contains all the assignment submitted to the course CS 1372 from Summer 2009.  The course focused on teaching programming principles using ANSI standard C code as the language.  The applications programmed in this class were designed to run on the Nintendo Gameboy Advance using a virtual GBA emulator.  The various projects included progamming games such as Frogger or Breakout.  Instructions on how to setup the environment to run these programs can be found in the GBA_Setup folder.  Each assignment has the description inside its folder and the required source code to run the program.
